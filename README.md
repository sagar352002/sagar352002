# 👋 Hi, I'm Sagar Kumar

### 🚀 Data Scientist | AI & ML Enthusiast | Strategy & Innovation Professional

I currently work at **ICICI Lombard General Insurance** in the **Strategy & Innovation** team, where I apply **data science, analytics, and automation** to solve real-world business problems and support data-driven decision-making.

I am deeply passionate about transforming complex data into **actionable insights**, building **scalable ML solutions**, and continuously advancing my skills toward becoming an **AI Engineer**. My experience spans analytics, visualization, modeling, and process optimization, with hands-on exposure to **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and Statistical Modeling**.

Beyond work, I’m a strong believer in discipline and balance. Fitness—through **yoga, gym workouts, and swimming**—keeps me focused, consistent, and resilient both professionally and personally.
